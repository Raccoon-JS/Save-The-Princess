Genre:
- Make a platformer, but use glitches "to subvert the player's expectation".
-- Make a very simplistic platformer game with "princess" on bottom.
--- But there is a hiddle hole under there.
-- Have "micro robotic bug" to interrogate bad bugs in the game.
- It begins with the Zelda-like game.
-- Actually, it begins with the menu. When the player press start, the evil laughter sound is on. 
--- Then cut to another menu screen. It has three options.
---- look at developer's notes,
----- it details out what went wrong
---- play the unfinished game, 
----- it's the Zelda clone but much simpler (3 stages) and different assets - almost collage-like.
---- or "interrogate bugs".
----- you confront bugs about talk about their problem (You know that game We Are Broken?).
